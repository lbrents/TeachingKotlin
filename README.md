# Learning Kotlin

### Introduction

Behold as I try to ~~poorly~~ teach programming in Kotlin!

Anyways...

Here is the quick rundown of what this is about: Kotlin is the name of the language we will be coding in. If you know Java, it can actually be very similar to that, but without some of the inconveniences like requiring a semicolon after every line. That being said, Kotlin also features some pretty advanced concepts that we will have to *delve* into to be able to program for the scouting tablets.

And lastly...

Coding for a mobile device like a phone or a tablet can be difficult at times, but is also very rewarding. The more familiar you get with this style of programming (hopefully), the easier any other style of programming should be. If you need any help, please do not hesitate to ask because just as you are learning to program, I am also learning how to ~~poorly~~ teach.
