# Variables

### Addressing The Allegations

Remember how we calculated 10 / 3 before and we got 3 instead of 3.33333... something or other? That is because numbers without decimals are automatically considered to be whole numbers. In Kotlin, division using whole numbers will always result in a whole number, always throwing away the decimal point and rounding down.

If we change our calculation to 10.0 / 3.0, we will get a much better looking result.

As an exercise, write the code to print 10.0 / 3.0 to the console.

...

So now we know that math with whole numbers will give us whole number and decimal numbers will give us decimal numbers.

### Data Types

Why is there a difference between whole numbers and decimal numbers?

The answer to that can be quite complicated so to give a general answer, it is because Kotlin uses something called data types. Data is pretty much any number or text that is stored in our program, but in order to use those types properly we categorize data into different types.

The following is a table categorizing the main types of data we will be using.
