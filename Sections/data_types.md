# Data Types

Building on top of the different types of things we can print using the `println` function, there is a concept known as data types that we need to keep in mind.

| Type | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| Int  | An Int (integer) is what we refer to as whole numbers. It represents all numbers between infinity and negative infinity, but no numbers with decimal points like 2.2 or -10.07. |
| Double | A Double is what we refer to as a decimal number. It theoretically represents all numbers between infinity and negative infinity as well as numbers like 2.2 and -10.7. Behind the scenes, doubles can be quite complicated so just know that ideally, we should only be using these when we need the precision. |
| Boolean | A Boolean represents the values of true and false. We use these to represent states like being either on or off. There are also some calculations we can perform, specific to booleans, that make them very useful.
| String | A String is just a string of text. Kotlin only knows if text is actually a string if it is surrounded by double quotes. |

> [!NOTE]
> There are more types than what is listed here, but for now these are the most important ones that we will be getting familiar with.

For now, keep these in mind as we go into the next section.
